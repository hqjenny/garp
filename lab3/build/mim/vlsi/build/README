This folder contains the ASIC scripts for building DREAMER.

The recommended design flow is:
cd dc-syn
make
cd ../icc-par
make

This should do automatic dependency resolution, including tracking RTL changes and building all the SRAMs in ../srams. If the srams don't automatically build, try running "make srams".
Note: cacti requires X forwarding to run.

Passing parameters to make allow different targets to be selected.
Examples:
make TARGET=Fix
  builds a single tile
make TARGET=NewFixGrid ROWS=8 COLS=8 PORTS=grid ARRAY=grid
  builds an 8x8 mesh network (see NetworkGenerator in fabric-new.scala in the RTL directory for options)

These folders are currently used:
dc-syn: synthesis
icc-dp, icc-par: place-and-route

These folders were used in MIM experiments and are currently unmaintained:
dc-dyn.tile
dc-syn.top
dc-syn.top.hier
idd-par.tile
icc-par.top

These folders aren't used at all (yet):
pt-pwr: power analysis
vcs-sim-gl-par: gate-level testbenches
vcs-sim-gl-syn: gate-level testbenches
vcs-sim-rtl: verilog testbenches
